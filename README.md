DECISION TREE ALGORITHM
The project implements the ID3 algorithm from scratch

The project has multiple phases
	1) Phase 1: Developing the algorithm using numpy and other standard modules 
		    except scikit-learn and trainin the tree on
		    MONKS dataset available on the UCI Repository
	2) Phase 2: Computing the confusion matrix for the learned 
		    decision tree for depths 1 and 2
	3) Phase 3: Visualizing the decision tree usin graphviz and 
		    compairing the results with decision tree made sklearn package
	

USAGE
	Each phase has been submitted as a separate python file. The files can run directly
	from the command line terminal. For Phase 1 the tree depths iterate from 1 through
	10 and for phase 2, it goes from 1 through 2

	For all the phases, the datasets need to be in the .data folder. The names of the
	files within the code need not be changed.  
	
	To avoid graphviz error, make sure graphviz is installed at 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin' for windows users
